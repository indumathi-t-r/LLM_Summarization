## LLM Text Summarization Project

This repository contains a project on large language model based text summarization. The goal of the project is to automatically generate concise summaries from long text documents using transformer models.

The project uses a pretrained BART model and fine-tunes it on the BillSum dataset, which contains US legislative documents and reference summaries. The notebook includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and summary generation.
